I am a Research Assistant Professor at the School of Engineering, University of Kansas (KU), where I collaborate closely with [Professor Huazhen Fang](https://fang.ku.edu/) (PI). I earned my Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2020. During 2017-2019, I had the privilege of being advised by [Professor Tamer Ba≈üar](http://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC), where I was a joint Ph.D. student. Before joining KU, I served as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, from 2021-2023, under the mentorship of [Professor Shreyas Sundaram](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sundara2/). During my postdoc at Purdue, I collaborated extensively with [Dr. Raid Ayoub](https://sites.google.com/view/raidayoub) and [Dr. Pietro Mercati](https://sites.google.com/site/pietromercati/home) from Intel Lab. I acquired substantial industry expertise through my roles as a research intern at Alibaba Group, focusing on recommendation systems and reinforcement learning in E-commerce, and as an FPGA algorithm engineer at Zhejiang Supcon Technology Co., Ltd.

Research Interest
------
My academic journey has been enriched by diverse experiences spanning academia and industry, shaping my interdisciplinary approach to research. I am dedicated to leveraging insights from both realms to address pressing challenges in industrial cyber-physical systems, control theory, and reinforcement learning. My current research is specifically focused in 

- Optimization and control problems in battery energy storage system (BESS)
- Incentive Stackelberg game
- Sample complexity analysis of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning
